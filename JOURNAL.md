## 10/30/2025 - Started Design  

After some web browsing, I finally decided to make a 75% keypad, I need to figure out how to make the PCB and get my schematic to work I still need to decide what chip to us. The Keyboard will be Bluetooth so I'll need my own battery in the keyboard but I'll do that later I'll probably do that today and figure out what key switches to use I want it  to be clicky but not so loud that it's annoying, This will not be a split keyboard because I don't want to try that maybe I'll try to make a mouse to go with this if I have extra time my image is off the layout I've decided I also need to do a choose my colors.

## 10/31/2025 - Finished up the design  

Found some inspiration for my color design, I'm going for a red black and white design My choice of switches is the Otemu Blue Switches the price is 20 cents per switches so around 21 dollars for me I decided for my switches to get the Carbon PBT Double Shot Orange Keycap Set this included all the Keycaps I want and also color replacements. I'll decide the chip as I start designing the PCB, I made some changes to the layout, next I'll start my scematic.
